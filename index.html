        <p>I am a civic-minded programmer applying my experience in journalism and local government to user-focused, full-stack web development. In my experience as a writer and radio producer, I have demonstrated my ability to meet deadlines and work as part of a multi-talented team to complete major projects under pressure. I am a detail-oriented, analytical thinker and have depended on my ability to quickly learn about complicated topics and distill them down for others.</p>

        <p>As a programmer, I am taking what I’ve learned about people’s needs to access information and services to create a better user experience for them. I’ve enrolled in the University of Texas at Austin Coding Bootcamp in order to accelerate this and have already gained great knowledge in front-end languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. I’m excited to develop my skills in back-end programming in order to harness the vast amounts of data that are being generated on a daily basis in order to improve people’s lives.</p>
